# Bonezegei_Scripting_Language
The Bonezegei Scripting Language (BSL) is a newly developed, dynamically typed programming language implemented through a custom interpreter written in the C language. It is designed primarily for rapid prototyping and the integration of embeddable logic within software systems. BSL features a simplified and intuitive syntax influenced by JavaScript and the C family of languages, promoting ease of adoption and efficient development. Despite its lightweight design, BSL is a fully Turing-complete language that supports essential modern programming constructs, including conditional and iterative control flows, user-defined functions, and object-oriented programming through class declarations, constructors, and methods. Source code is encapsulated within files using the unique .bzg extension, emphasizing the languageâ€™s self-contained architecture.
